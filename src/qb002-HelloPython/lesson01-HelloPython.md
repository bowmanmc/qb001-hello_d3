## Introduction
Hello! Welcome to the Introduction to Python course by
QuickBits. We're excited to help you along your journey to becoming a
Python developer.

Today we'll be going over the history of Python and its place in the world
of programming. We'll then get acquainted with the development environment
we'll be using for this course and create our first program in Python!


## Brief History of Python
The
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)](Python programming language)
was first released to the public in 1991 by
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum](Guido van Rossum),
and has become one of the most popular programming languages in use today.
Its strengths are in code readability and simplicity, as well as a large set of
community contributed libraries. It is an extremely flexible language that is
used for web development, scientific computing, and data science.


## Python 2 vs 3
Python 3.x is a major, backwards-incompatible release of the language. That means
programs written against an older 2.x version of the language won't run
with Python 3. Despite being released in 2008, you'll still see lots of programs
and scripts out there written agains the older version of the language. We'll
be using the newest version of Python for this course, but keep this in mind
when running Python on your own machine... many operating systems
(such as Max OS X) still have python 2.x installed as the default python
interpreter.
